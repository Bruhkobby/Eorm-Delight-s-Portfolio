    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Elorm Delight Brown, a creative multimedia specialist with a passion for storytelling through design, visuals, and technology. Based in Accra, Ghana, I bring a unique blend of artistic vision and technical skill to every project I undertake. I specialize in graphic design, video editing, motion design, UI/UX design, and digital branding — with hands-on experience using industry-standard tools like Photoshop, After Effects, Figma, and Audacity.

I began my creative journey working with churches and local businesses, helping them bring their visions to life through eye-catching flyers, promotional videos, and social media content. I’ve also had the opportunity to intern with a professional photographer and videographer, gaining real-world experience in shooting, editing, and producing high-quality visuals for events and clients.

Currently, I’m pursuing my education at DevWorld Tech Academy, where I'm sharpening my skills in software development, web design, and motion graphics. Through every project — whether it's a flyer for a church program, a website prototype, or a cinematic video edit — I aim to combine design thinking with meaningful impact.

My approach is always detail-driven, people-focused, and fueled by curiosity. I love exploring new styles and techniques, staying on top of design trends, and using creativity as a tool to solve problems and connect with audiences. In everything I do, I strive to not just make things look good — but to make them communicate powerfully.

If you're looking for someone who’s passionate, reliable, and deeply invested in their craft, I’d love to collaborate.</p>
